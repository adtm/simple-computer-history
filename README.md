The first recognised device for computing was the [Abbacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) at around 2300 - 2700 BC. It enabled people to calculate bigger amounts of data using an apparatus. Also, not storing the information in their head but in an external device, memory.

#### ..Pascaline (TODO)

In 1642 Blaise Pascal, at the age of 19, designed the Pascal's calculator (Pascaline). A mechanical calculator, which was able to do addition and substraction by turning dials. Also, it included a carry mechanism, which can carry a 1 to the other number. The calculator was meant to aid in the work of his father, a tax collector. Even though he achieved a Royal Priviledge at 1649, he only produced 20 machines, which had too big of a cost and complexity.

The first calculator, which was capable to perform all 4 arithmetical operations was created by [Gottfield Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) in 1694. The main idea is to use a rotation mechanism which will rotate the numbers to add or substract. Multiplication and division is expressed by multiple additions and substractions by turning the wheel.

For example if you want to do `5 x 5 = ?`. You will set input to `0`, and counter to `5` and turn the dial `5` times. For division `25 / 5 = ?`. You will set the input to `25` and counter to `5` and turn the dial `5` times just to the opposite below position.
