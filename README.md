The first recognized device for computing was the [Abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) at around 2300 – 2700 BC. It enabled people to calculate bigger amounts of data using an apparatus. Also, not storing the information in their head but in an external device, memory.

In 1642 Blaise Pascal, at the age of `19`, designed the Pascal's calculator (Pascaline). A mechanical calculator, which was able to do addition and subtraction by turning dials. Also, it included a carry mechanism, which can carry a 1 to the other number. The calculator was meant to aid in the work of his father, a tax collector. Even though he achieved a Royal Privilege at 1649, he only produced 20 machines, which had too big of a cost and complexity.

The first calculator, which was capable to perform all 4 arithmetical operations was created by [Gottfield Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) in 1694. The main idea is to use a rotation mechanism which will rotate the numbers to add or subtract. Multiplication and division is expressed by multiple additions and subtractions by turning the wheel.

For example if you want to do `5 x 5 = ?`. You will set input to `0`, and counter to `5` and turn the dial `5` times. For division `25 / 5 = ?`. You will set the input to `25` and counter to `5` and turn the dial `5` times just to the opposite below position.

The Stepped Reckoner was a huge success and was used for around `200` years. But it didn't allow doing advanced calculations — as a result [pre-computed tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomputation) were used. Which were books with various already done calculations — like to which angle you have to turn a cannon in order to hit the enemy ship. But the main problem was that a new canon would require a new pre-computed table, and they were a long and an expensive task for mathematicians.
